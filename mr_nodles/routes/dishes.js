  'Yakisoba': "Yakisoba is perhaps one of Japan's best known street foods and it literally means 'grilled noodles'. If you've ever been to an event in Japan, you probably remember the smell of the fruity, spicy sauce caramelizing on giant teppans (cast iron griddles) with the noodles.",

  'Ramen': "Ramen, despite its reputation as a cheap fast food, is a complex pillar of modern Japanese society, one loaded with political, cultural and culinary importance that stretches far beyond the circumference of the bowl. And all those big ideas start in Fukuoka, ground zero for the ramen craze."
