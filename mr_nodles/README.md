# Mr Nodles

A basic Node.js/Express.js app inspired by noodles and the Code School [Express course](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/building-blocks-of-express-js).

The app contains several comments that may be useful for creating our Nodeboard to-do list.

## Setup

Install module dependencies with `npm install`, then run the app with `nodemon`.
A custom logger will log the HTTP requests as they occur.
```
$ npm install
$ nodemon index.js
```
